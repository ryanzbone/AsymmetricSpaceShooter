# AsymmetricSpaceShooter

## Current Plan

 - 2v2 ships with rockets.
 - One player controls ship, other controls rockets.
 - Rockets have a constant force driving them forward and  can be steered left and right a little.
 - Rockets can be detonated in order to fire another.
 - Rockets must hit other ship to count as a hit.
 - Detonations will apply an outward force which can effect other rockets, ships, and environmental objects.

### Other possibilities
 - Limited number of rockets with pickups to get more.
 - Environmental objects to avoid that can damage ship, move around, can be used against enemy by shooting them with rockets to move them.
 - Dodge mechanic

### considerations
 - [ ] multiple thrusters
 - [ ] evasive manuvers/quick dodge mechanic
 - [ ] multiple cannons
 - [ ] enemies
 - [ ] different targets
 - [ ] environmental hazards

### further considerations
 - [ ] fog and headlights
 - [ ] scout ships
 - [ ] grapple beams
   - [ ] grab ships, enemies can still move and shoot, but now you're attached to them. Total movment determined by both ships' thrust.
   - [ ] grab environment, stationary and free moving
 - [ ] warp drives
   - [ ] [telefrag](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Telefrag)
 - [ ] guided missiles
   - [ ] autonomous
   - [ ] manual
 - [ ] synchronous resonance
 - [ ] physics simulation for thrusters on different size/mass objects
